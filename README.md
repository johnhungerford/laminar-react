Examples of Laminar components modeled after React

## Run examples

To run the examples in a browser execute the following SBT command:

```shell
sbt "startDevServer; ~fastLinkJS/prepareBundleSources; stopDevServer"
```

This will compile all the code to Javascript, bundle it, and deploy in a browser, hot reloading any changes.

## Article

See [LAMINAR-REACT.md](LAMINAR-REACT.md) for a discussion of how to use Laminar in a React-like style and explanations of the various examples.
